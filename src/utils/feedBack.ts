        text: `Our locality, Jammu and Kashmir is a challenging hilly region,
                where reaching to remote communities is difficult. Economically
                and educationally, these areas remain underdeveloped. So, here
                comes the importance of organizations which can satisfy the
                needs of people. YES India Foundation is one of such
                organizations which proved very successful in our region. I have
                seen for the last 15 years, they have made successful
                interventions in the system here as I have been invited in many
                programs as guest in the title, the principal and professor of
                Degree College Poonch. So, their main focus is to remain on the
                dimension of creating scientific temperament among younger
                generation and contribute towards the promotion of different
                culture and civilizations here. My opinion about this
                organization is that it has done a wonderful job in this
                challenging area.`,
